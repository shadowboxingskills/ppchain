ü§î What is this?
--------

Generative AI meets Probabilistic Programming.
``ppchain`` an open-source toolkit for intuitive, effective modeling.
Your copilot to build model internal representations and optimize your Bayesian workflow.

|

üöÄ What can this help with?
--------

``ppchain`` aims to ease the pains of building a model.

Following the 3 main steps of the Bayesian data analysis process, as defined in [1]_, ``ppchain`` provides a (progressively growing) toolbox of AI-assisted functions aiming to make your life easier along the way:

1. Setting up a full probability model‚Äîa joint probability distribution for all observable and unobservable quantities in a problem. ``ppchain`` searches for domain knowledge about your underlying problem and helps building an internal representation that is consistent with both background knowledge and collected data.

2. Conditioning on observed data: calculating and interpreting the appropriate posterior distribution‚Äîthe conditional probability distribution of the unobserved quantities of ultimate interest, given the observed data.

3. Evaluating the fit of the model and the implications of the resulting posterior distribution: how well does the model fit the data? are the substantive conclusions reasonable? and how sensitive are the results to the modeling assumptions made?

|

‚öô Workflow
--------

``ppchain`` proposes a set of AI-assisted functions to progress through the following workflow:

* Define the problem statement
* Formalize priors, :math:`$P(\theta)$`
* Determine the likelihood function, :math:`$P(y \mid \theta)$`
* Compute the posterior distribution, :math:`$P(\theta \mid y)$`
* Run posterior inference
